Describe the gameplay:
- Two paddles are bouncing a ball back a forth
What are the conditions when the game begins?
- The game beings when one player moves their paddle
Does the game have an end? If so, what are the conditions for when it ends?
- When one player gets to 11 points
What ifs will there be?
- If the ball crosses over the board edge, then the opposite player earns a point.
- If the ball hits the bottom or top of the board, reverse its direction
- If the ball hits the paddle, reverse the direction of the ball
- If player hits up or down arrow key, move the paddle in that right direction
- If a player scores 11 points, end the game a show the winner
- If the ball hits one of the paddles, increase ball speed
- If the paddle hits the top or bottom edge of the board, stop the paddle
- If the ball hits, board edge, return the ball to the middle of the board and reset speed

Visual game components:
What are the visual game components? For example, in Bouncing Box, the game components were the board and the box.
- two paddles a ball the black background the dotted line in the middle
Which will be static? (the board)
- the board and line
Which will be animated? (the box)
the ball and the paddles
What data will you need to manage each game component? For example, in Bouncing Box, the data values were positionX, speedX, and points.
- positionX positionY speedX speedY

Events/Logic:
What events will occur in this game? (timer events, keyboard events, clicking events?)
- keydown keyup ball touching the paddle
How do those events affect the data of the program?
- move the paddles
- one player uses keys other player uses other
For each "event", write out the high-level logic of what will happen. It is better (and tricky) to be as specific as you can while remaining high-level!
- $(document).on("keydown", handleKeyDown)
handleKeyDown(event){
    (even.which === key.up){
        move paddle up
        increase position y
        maybe we will decrease the "top" css position 
    }
}

(event.which === key.down){
    move paddle down
    adjust postition y
}

when the ball hits the paddle{
change the direction of the ballincrease speed of the ball
}

- score will be in the middle of the half of the board for e3ach side
- scoreboard will tick up by one
- score ticks up after the ball passes the edge
- when ball goes past right side left score ticks up and vice versa
